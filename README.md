### Tailwind Custom Plugins

`input.css`: Extra base layers to make a font family from external font files for easy use
![Tailwind Base Layer](./assets/readme/base%20layer.png)

`tailwind.config.js`: Custom colors, media breakpoints, line heights, search bar background
![Tailwind Plugins](./assets/readme/tailwind%20plugins.png)

### Building / package.json scripts

After cloning the files into your local machine, run

`npm install`

to install the dev dependencies

`npm run buildcss`

which is defined in `package.json` to run

`npx tailwindcss -i input.css -o style.css --watch`

And you should be good to go to edit the files using your own tailwindcss.

To make the CSS file as small and efficient as possible, a script for that is also present for production.

`npm run minify`

which is defined in the `package,json` to run

`npx tailwindcss -o style.css --minify`
